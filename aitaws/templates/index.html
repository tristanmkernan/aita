            After seeing <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/">/r/AmItheAsshole/</a> in my feed a bit too
            often, and finding that MOST people were definitely
            the asshole and merely seeking validation for their shitty behavior, I just had to put it to the test and
            record the results over a decent period of time. You're welcome to participate! Go to <a
                href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/">/r/AmItheAsshole/</a>,
            read the stories, and make your judgment!
